1. What Is the Purpose of the Pass Statement?

The pass statement is used when there's a syntactic but not an operational requirement. 
For example - The program below prints a string ignoring the spaces.


2. What are the three main conditional statements in Python?

if, elif, and else


3. Illustrate a basic if, elif, else structure.

if <condition>:
. . .
elif <another condition>:
. . .
else:
. . .


4. What does elif mean?

It means else if. It is used after an if statement, to do another comparison.


5. How are if, elif, and else blocks defined?

All blocks in Python are defined by indenting.
All lines of a particular code block must have the same level of indenting.


6.  Illustrate a switch-case equivalent using if-elif-else.

if item=valueA:
. . .
elif item == valueB:
. . .
elif item = =  valueC:
. . .
elif item = valueN:
. . .
else:
… #default code


7. How is the Python switch statement used?

This is a trick question, there is no built-in switch statement in Python, which is unusual.
A switch statement can be easily created using if-elif using lambda or with Python dictionaries.


8. Illustrate comparing two strings for equality in a case insensitive manner.

if string_l. lower ( ) = string2.lower ( ):
#Note: .upper( ) is equally valid.


9. How would you use a “if ” statement to check whether an integer is even ?

x = int(input("enter number : ")) 
if x%2 == 0:
    print("You have entered an even number")


10. What is the meaning of conditional branching?

Deciding whether certain sets of instructions must be executed or not based on the value of an expression is called conditional branching.


11. what does a control structure directs in a Python program?

Directs the order of execution of the statements in the program


12. What signifies the end of a statement block or suite in Python?

A line that is indented less than the previous line


13. what is the output of the following code snippet

if 'bar' in {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2, 'baz': 3}:
    print(1)
    print(2)
    if 'a' in 'qux':
        print(3)
print(4)

1
2
4


14. Suppose you have the following variables defined:

a = 100
b = 50
Write a Python if/else statement to assign the smaller of a and b to the variable m.

if a < b:
    m = a
else:
    m = b


15. What is the value of below expression:

'a' + 'x' if '123'.isdigit() else 'y' + 'b'

'ax'


16. Suppose you have two variables x and y defined. Write a stub if statement to evaluate whether x is less than y. 
    The statement should not do anything, even if the condition is true.

if x < y:
    pass


17. What are conditional statements in Python

A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. 
These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.


18. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

nl=[]
for x in range(1500, 2701):
    if (x%7==0) and (x%5==0):
        nl.append(str(x))
print (','.join(nl))


19. how many types of conditional statements are there in python

Python has 3 key Conditional Statements that you should know: if statement. if-else statement. if-elif-else ladder.


20. Write a python program to check whether you are eligible to vote or not?

age = int(input("Enter voters age:"))
if age >= 18:
    print("You can cast your vote!")
else:
    print("Sorry! You are not eligible to vote!")
