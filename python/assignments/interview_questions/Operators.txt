1. What Does the // Operator Do?

In Python, the / operator performs division and returns the quotient in the float.
For example: 5 / 2 returns 2.5
The // operator, on the other hand, returns the quotient in integer.
For example: 5 // 2 returns 2


2. What Does the ‘is’ Operator Do?

The ‘is’ operator compares the id of the two objects. 


3. What is the purpose of ‘not’, ‘is’, and ‘in’ operators?

not- returns the boolean value's inverse
is- returns true when both operands are true
in- determines whether a certain element is present in a series


4. What are the different types of operators in Python?

Arithmetic (Addition(+), Substraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Modulus(%) ),
Relational (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, ),
Assignment (=. +=, -=, /=, *=, %= ),
Logical (and, or not ), Membership, Identity, and Bitwise Operators


5. Explain the ternary operator in Python.

Unlike C++, we don’t have ?: in Python, but we have this:
[on true] if [expression] else [on false]
If the expression is True, the statement under [on true] is executed. Else, that under [on false] is executed.


6. What are assignment operators in Python?

We can combine all arithmetic operators with the assignment symbol.

>>> a=7
>>> a+=1
>>> a
8

>>> a-=1
>>> a
7

>>> a*=2
>>> a
14

>>> a/=2
>>> a
7.0

>>> a**=2
>>> a
49.0

>>> a//=3
>>> a
16.0

>>> a%=4
>>> a


7. Explain logical operators in Python.

We have three logical operators- and, or, not.

>>> False and True
False

>>> 7<7 or True
True

>>> not 2==2
False


8. What are membership operators?

With the operators ‘in’ and ‘not in’, we can confirm if a value is a member in another.


9. What are the comparison operators in Python?

< Less than, > Greater than, <= Less than or equal to, >= Greater than or equal to, = Equal to,
!= not equal, o alternative not equal. Note a single = is NOT a Python comparison operator, it is an assignment operator only.


10. What is the difference between a = 10 and a= = 10?

The expression a = 10 assigns the value 10 to variable a, whereas a == 10 checks if the value of a is equal to 10 or not. 
If yes then it returns ‘Ti^te’ else it will return ‘False’. 


11. What are the basic rules of operator precedence in Python?

The basic rule of operator precedence in Python is as follows:

Expressions must be evaluated from left to right.
Expressions of parenthesis are performed first.

Parenthesis
Exponent
Multiplication
Division
Addition
Subtraction


12. What is the difference between implicit expression and explicit expression?

Conversion is the process of converting one data type into another. Two types of conversion in Python are as follows:

Implicit type conversion
Explicit type Conversion

When Python automatically converts one data type to another it is called implicit conversion.
Explicit conversion is when the developer has to explicitly convert datatype of an object to carry out an operation.


13. What is the another name of Comparison Operators?

Relational Operators


14. Explain Operators and Operands?

Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.
The values the operator uses are called Operands.


15. What will be the output of the following code

a = 12 
a, b = a+1, a+1
print a 
print b

2
2


16. What value have been check by ” < = ” operator?

It checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, 
if yes then condition becomes true


17. What is the use of “%” operator?

The “%” operator divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder.


18. What do you mean by Operator precedence?

Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression.
This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; 
for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator


19. Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; then find the values of the following :A&BA|B

Here in binary format they will be as follows:
A = 0011 1100
B = 0000 1101

hence
A&B = 0000 1100 and A|B = 00111101


20. Explain assigning values to variables in Python.

Python variables do not have to be explicitly declared to reserve memory space.
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.
The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
